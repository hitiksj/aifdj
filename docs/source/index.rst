ðŸ“œ The SQL Linter for Humans
============================

Bored of not having a good SQL linter that works with whichever dialect
you're working with? Fluff is an extensible and modular linter designed
to help you write good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits
your database.

Notable releases:

* **1.0.x**: First *stable* release, no major changes to take advantage of a
  point of relative stability.
* **2.0.x**: Recode of rules, whitespace fixing consolidation,
  :code:`sqlfluff fix` and removal of support for dbt versions pre `1.1`.
  Note, that this release brings with it some breaking changes to rule coding
  and configuration, see :ref:`upgrading_2_0`.

For more detail on other releases, see our :ref:`releasenotes`.

Getting Started

have python or pip already installed see :ref:`gettingstartedref`.
