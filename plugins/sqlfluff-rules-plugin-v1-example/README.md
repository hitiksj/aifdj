# Example V1 rules plugin

This example plugin showcases the ability to setup
installable rule plugins using the v1 specification
of that interface.

This requires rules to have codes _only_ and requires
one rule to be implemented at a time. For a more flexible
rules API, consider using the v2 interface as shown
in `sqlfluff-rules-plugin-v2-example`.
